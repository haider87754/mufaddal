Free Open Source Software (FOSS), also called just Open Source or Free Software, is licensed to be free to use, modify, and distribute.  Most FOSS licenses also include a kind of legal Golden Rule, requiring any changes - such as fixes and enhancements - be released under the same license.
This creates the trust in developers and users that generates large, sustainable communities that grow the software over time .
Getting steadily better for more than a quarter century, FOSS provides more capability, security, and sustainability at much less cost, and is increasingly the first software option for individuals and organizations alike.
